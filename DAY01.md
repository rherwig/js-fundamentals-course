# Programming Fundamentals
This document holds protocol information for learning the fundamentals of programming using JavaScript as an example.
It will be dynamically extended - depending on the topics discussed.

## Experience
- Close to no experience
- Experienced sites and apps as user

## Goals
- Make Edge not become a theory-obsessed idiot
- Learn the fundamentals first - then the fancy combos
- Learn the basics of JavaScript
- Have a plan, where to go next!

## Programming
A general overview of programming and the concepts used within.

- Solving a problem with the assistance of software

### What kinds of programming are there?
Programming takes place in specific "areas" within an application. What are they?

- Frontend - Things the user of your app sees (this is what Rico does)
- Backend - Place where data gets managed and prepared for sending to the frontend
- Database - Actual data storage (Files and Folders, SQL, NoSQL, Document-Storage, ...)
- Server Engineers / DevOps - Setup new servers, manage existing ones, deal with security
- Ethical hackers / Penetration Testers - Break their own software to find security flaws
- Systems-Programming - Interaction with hardware (CPU, RAM, Periphery)
- AI Programming - Neural networks, ChatGPT, Tensorflow
- Game Development - Mix of Systems, Backend and Frontend - Relies on Engines (Unity, Unreal, Cry, ...)

Where is Edge (Prediction): Runs a basic website with frontend, backend and database -> Full-Stack

### JavaScript: A brief history

- Invented in 1995 for the Netscape Browser (successor of Mosaic)
- Only for one browser
- Microsoft came and said: We want JavaScript as well!
  - MS didn't get to use it
  - They developed their OWN JavaScript, called JScript
- Now, there are two browsers (Netscape, Internet Explorer) and two JS dialects === chaos from the start
- Other browser vendors also wanted JavaScript
  - They developed their own dialects as well
- As a developer: Be aware of ALL the existing dialects of JS, to develop apps for all browsers
  - Solution to this problem: Abstract those different functions away -> jQuery library was born
- ECMA said: We need to standardize JavaScript - let's call it ECMAScript
- Browsers began adopting the ECMA standard (ECMAScript 3, ES5, ...)
- ECMAScript6 aka. ECMAScript 2015 was the first REAL standard implemented by all modern browsers
- No need for jQuery and other abstractions to make life easy again
- Nowdays, there is a new version of ECMAScript every year - ECMAScript2023 is the currently most recent one
  - Newer versions do not entirely CHANGE the language, but rather build upon it and extend it

We will be using ECMAScript 2015 and later and thank fuck for having access to that!

### Common Concepts
These concepts are commonly used in most programming languages.
