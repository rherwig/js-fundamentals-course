// Before google searching : 
// It treats a and b constants as numbers when used in a calculaction and does not treat it as boolean/balooney
// So basically it assigned both a and b a value of 1, since both constants are similar - therefore after calculation end result is 2


// After google search : 
// Initially it brings up functions in search, so first thought is - the running command treats both constants indeed as numeric
// The reason why google was giving a function, seems to be google searches related to constants
